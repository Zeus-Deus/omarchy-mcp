  "content": "Omarchy is intended as a starting point for you to build your own ideal environment, so many of the config files are generated directly, and you're invited to tweak them. But there are also pointers into Omarchy's defaults that you can update from time to time to get the latest through Update > Omarchy in the Omarchy menu (Super + Alt + Space).\n\nThis pulls the latest Omarchy code, runs any pending migrations to get your system in sync with the latest, and then updates all system packages from both the official Arch repository, the Omarchy Package Repository, and the AUR.\n\nWhen new releases are made, a circle arrow icon will appear to the right of your clock. Click it and the update process will start.\n\nIf you're already familiar with Arch, you might be tempted to just run pacman -Syu yourself, but if you do that, you run the risk that you'll miss updates to the configuration files needed to support newer versions of libraries or tools. So it's best to stick with Update > Omarchy, so you're sure that any migrations are run together with new packages.\n\nIf you ever have a problem after doing an update, you can rollback your system to the snapshot taken before the update."
