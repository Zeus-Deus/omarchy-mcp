  "content": "Omarchy is installed using an ISO. It's designed for a dedicated drive, so dual-booting requires two disks in your machine (unless you do a manual install to work around this). The installation will wipe the selected drive and use full-disk encryption, so be sure to take a backup before using an existing drive!\n\nDownload the Omarchy ISO first, put it on a USB stick (use balenaEtcher on Mac/Windows or caligula on Linux), and boot off the stick.\n\nRemember that many PCs ship with Secure Boot and/or TPM on in the BIOS. You have to turn these off to be able to install Omarchy. They're Microsoft security schemes meant for Windows and Microsoft-affiliated Linux distributions.\n\nThen answer the configuration questions, and confirm them like this:\n\nThen select a drive for your installation, and sit back and watch the installation show go. It takes between 2-10 minutes, depending on the speed of your computer.\n\nNow you're ready to Omarchy!\n\nThe full-disk encryption won't allow you to enter the password from a Bluetooth keyboard at startup. Just like you can't use a Bluetooth keyboard to enter the BIOS on a PC. You'll need a keyboard that either uses a 2.4ghz dongle or a cable (which is much nicer for latency anyway!). I personally love the Lofree Flow84!\n\nIf you get stuck, you can usually find someone willing to help in the #omarchy-help channel on the community Discord.\n\nIf you have special needs, like installing Omarchy onto M-Series MacBooks Asahi Alarm or because you want to try dual-booting on a single drive, you should follow the instructions for a manual installation."
