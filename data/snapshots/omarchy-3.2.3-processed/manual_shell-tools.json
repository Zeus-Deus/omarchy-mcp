  "content": "In addition to the standard Linux tools, Omarchy also ships with a bunch of enhanced shell tools. Here are the key ones.\n\nfzf gives you fuzzy finding of files via the ff alias. Go to any directory, type ff, and you'll be able to fuzzy find your way to any file in that tree, while seeing a preview of the files you're narrowing down on the right-hand side.\n\nYou can use Ctrl + R to use fzf to fuzzy find through your command history.\n\nThis tool is also used by Neovim when you type Space Space.\n\nThe full manual can be found via man fzf.\n\nZoxide is a replacement for cd. It remembers the directories you've been in, so you can more easily jump to them next time. Say you do cd ~/.local/share/omarchy once. Next time, you can just do cd omarchy (or even just cd oma), and Zoxide will take you directly there.\n\ncd ~/.local/share/omarchy\n\nThe full manual can be found via man zoxide.\n\nripgrep searches the contents of files by using rg <pattern> <path>, like rg Controller app/ to find all mentions of Controller in the directory app.\n\nThis tool is also used by Neovim when you type Space S G.\n\nThe full manual can be found via man rg.\n\neza is a replacement for ls. It gives you directory listings with more information, color, and icons. By default, eza has been aliased as ls. You can also use lt to get a listing of two-deep levels of nesting. lsa gives you a listing including hidden files. And lta a nested listing with hidden files.\n\nThe full manual can be found via man eza.\n\nfd is an easier to use replacement for find. Use fd person.rb to find a file called person.rb within the current tree. fd person.rb / will search the entire file system. fd person.rb / -H searches the entire file system, including hidden directories.\n\nThe full manual can be found via man fd.\n\ntry makes it easy to manage programming experiments with date-stamped directories. All experiments live in ~/Work/tries and you can access them via try."
