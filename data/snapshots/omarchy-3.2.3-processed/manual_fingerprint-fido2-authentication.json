  "content": "A lot of laptops, like my beloved Framework 13, come with a fingerprint sensor to do authentication. You can use this with Omarchy by running Setup > Security > Fingerprint in the Omarchy menu (Super + Alt + Space). That'll install the fingerprint package, collect your print, verify it, and you'll be set to go using your fingerprint to unlock from the lock screen (which you can trigger with Super + Escape), enter sudo mode, and authorize system prompts.\n\nIf you've setup fingerprint authentication, but then need to work on an external keyboard that doesn't have it, just hit CTRL + C, when you're prompted for your fingerprint during sudo.\n\nYou can remove the fingerprint authentication under Remove > Fingerprint in the Omarchy menu.\n\nBoth adding and removing fingerprint authentication is also available through the Omarchy TUI under the Setup menu.\n\nIf you're using a Fido2 device, you can set it up for sudo authentication using Setup > Security > Fido2 in the Omarchy menu (Super + Alt + Space). It's only for sudo, though, not unlocking your computer.\n\nYou can remove the fido2 authentication under Remove > Fido2 in the Omarchy menu."
