  "content": "Omarchy ships with a nice, basic PDF viewer called Document Viewer. This is the program that'll open any PDFs you just double click on.\n\nBut you can only use Document Viewer to fill out PDFs that have been setup as forms. If you need to fill out PDFs that haven't, or you need to sign a PDF, you'll have to right-click the file, select Open With..., and pick Xournal++.\n\nXournal++ will let you write anywhere on a PDF using the T tool. If you need to sign a document, you'll need an image of your signature, and you can use the Image tool to insert this signature and resize it.\n\nWhen you're done filling out the PDF, use File > Export as PDF to save the final version."
