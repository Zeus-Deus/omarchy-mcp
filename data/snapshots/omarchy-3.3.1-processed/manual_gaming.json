  "content": "Omarchy isn't just for pRoDUcTiVItY, it's also for having fun, and what's more fun than gaming? Two of the best options for playing games on Omarchy are Steam (modern games) and Retroarch (retro games).\n\nThanks to Valve's incredible work on the proton compatibility layer, there are now tens of thousands of playable modern games on Linux. Oh, and did you know that the Steam Deck actually runs Arch!\n\nInstall Steam by selecting Install > Gaming > Steam from the Omarchy menu (Super + Alt + Space).\n\n(Make sure you pick the packages made for your GPU! If you're on an AMD with an iGPU, just pick the first package. Otherwise there are options for Nvidia and Radeon.)\n\nAfter you've installed it, you'll be able to launch Steam with Super + Space and typing steam.\n\nNote that Steam can take 10-20 seconds to start up, and it's not going to provide any visual feedback that it's loading.\n\nInstall RetroArch by selecting Install > Gaming > RetroArch from the Omarchy menu (Super + Alt + Space).\n\nAfter you've installed it, you'll be able to launch Retroarch with Super + Space and typing retro.\n\nIf you want to run RetroArch in fullscreen, best to just launch it with retroarch --fullscreen from a terminal.\n\nretroarch --fullscreen\n\nInstall Minecraft by selecting Install > Gaming > Minecraft from the Omarchy menu (Super + Alt + Space).\n\nLike Steam, note that it can take a while after logging in or starting up for the next screen to appear, and you're not going to get any feedback while you're waiting.\n\nInstall support for Xbox controllers by selecting Install > Xbox Controllers from the Omarchy menu (Super + Alt + Space). You'll need to restart your system after the installation. Then you can pair the controllers via bluetooth and have them working in all games."
