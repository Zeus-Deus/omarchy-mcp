  "content": "This is a collection of common tailorings to the Omarchy setup. Know that it might occasionally be necessary for system updates to restore certain configs to their original condition. If this happens, your changes won't be lost, but put in a .bak file in the same directory.\n\nIf you screw something up, you can restore individual configs to their original setup via Update > Config in the Omarchy menu. If you really screw everything up, you can reset all configs via omarchy-reinstall.\n\nBy default, tray icons, like Dropbox, 1password, or Steam, are hidden behind the tray expander icon. If you'd like to have them exposed all the time, you can change the group/tray-expander line to tray in Waybar's ~/.config/waybar/config.jsonc (access via Setup > Config > Waybar).\n\n~/.config/waybar/config.jsonc\n\nOmarchy's default design is one of square corners, but if you like to soften that up a bit, you can change ~/.config/hypr/looknfeel.conf so rounding is no longer commented out:\n\n~/.config/hypr/looknfeel.conf\n\ndecoration {\n    # Use round window corners\n    rounding = 8\n}\n\ndecoration {\n    # Use round window corners\n    rounding = 8\n}\n\nOn laptop displays, some people prefer to not to waste any pixels on window gaps (or even a top bar, which you can toggle off with Super + Shift + Space). You can remove all gaps by removing the comments in this section of ~/.config/hypr/looknfeel.conf:\n\nSuper + Shift + Space\n\n~/.config/hypr/looknfeel.conf\n\ngeneral {\n    # No gaps between windows or borders\n    gaps_in = 0\n    gaps_out = 0\n    border_size = 0\n}\n\ngeneral {\n    # No gaps between windows or borders\n    gaps_in = 0\n    gaps_out = 0\n    border_size = 0\n}"
