  "content": "OpenCode is an AI agent harness, like Claude Code or Gemini CLI, that works with all the commercial and open-weight models. Best way to use it is via the c alias, which you invoke once you're inside the directory you want to work on with AI.\n\nLazygit is a delightful alternative to something like the GitHub Desktop application, and it runs inside the terminal.\n\nYou can run it directly, by going to any directory managed by git and running lazygit. Or you can run it inside Neovim where it can be started with Space G G.\n\nYou hop between the different panes using Tab. In the Files pane, you select files for staging using Space, and then you can create a new commit using c. You can see all the commands available using ?.\n\nLazydocker is made in the same spirit like Lazygit, and also gives you a terminal interface for managing your containers and images.\n\nYou can start it with Super + Shift + D.\n\nYou stop a container using s or start/restart it using r. See all commands using ?.\n\nBtop is a beautiful resource manager that shows memory, CPU, disk, and network usage. It also lists all active processes, and allows you to manage them.\n\nOmarchy has added an app for it called Activity, which you can start from the application launcher. But it's quicker to just hit Super + Shift + T.\n\nImpala is a TUI for managing your Wi-Fi connection. You hop between sections on tab, then select a network with space. If a password is needed, just input and hit return. It's available by clicking the Wi-Fi icon in the top menu bar.\n\nBlueTUI is a TUI for managing your Bluetooth connections. It's made by the same creator as Impala and works the same way.\n\nFastfetch shows system information, like kernel version, uptime, theme, CPU, memory, and more. It's a successor to the popular neofetch tool.\n\nOmarchy has packaged this as About in the Omarchy menu (Super + Alt + Space)."
