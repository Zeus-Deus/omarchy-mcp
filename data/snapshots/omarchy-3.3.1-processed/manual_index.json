You can install it using Install > Windows from the Omarchy menu (Super + Alt + Space). It takes a while, but you can follow the progress in the browser.\n\nWhen the installation is complete, you can launch Windows using the app launcher, and that'll give you a RDP connection to your installation. There's no GPU passthrough with this setup, so it's not suitable for gaming or video editing, but it's a great way to run apps like Microsoft Office or whatever else if you absolutely must have that.\n\nThe directory ~/Windows in your home directory is automatically shared with this Windows VM. So you put files there if you want to make them accessible to Windows. The VM does not have access to any other files on your system, so you're safe from malware or viruses on the Linux side.\n\nYou can change the resource allocation by editing ~/.config/windows/docker-compose.yml.
