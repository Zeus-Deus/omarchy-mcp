    "content": "### New stable Arch mirror\r\n\r\nWith hundreds of thousands of people having downloaded the Omarchy ISO, it's time to ensure that the bleeding edge of Arch package upgrades isn't automatically rolling out to everyone without vetting. So we're introducing a new stable mirror that'll lag the latest by a month. It'll grab a snapshot of the latest repo on the first of the month, then upload that on the last Monday at 10am UTC of the month. This will allow a smaller group of package pioneers to catch problems and fix them before everyone upgrades. That should dramatically lower the risk that we see incompatibility issues in the wild at a large scale.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in being part of the Omarchy Package Pioneers, you can run `omarchy-refresh-pacman-mirrorlist edge`. That'll put you on the edge mirror where all new packages are immediately available. Please pull early and often, and help us catch future issues!\r\n\r\n### Ghostty is the new default terminal\r\n\r\n[Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) is a fantastic terminal created by @mitchellh, which natively supports splits and tabs. We've made it the default for new installations. Existing users can switch using _Install > Terminal_. Alacritty + Kitty remains as optional installs on new installations.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"4396\" height=\"3284\" alt=\"ghostty\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6671b07-4d47-4390-bd98-bd5432c6a779\" />\r\n\r\nYou can see all keybinds on `ghostty +list-keybinds`, but here's a quick cheatsheet:\r\n\r\n* `Ctrl + Shift + O` split vertically.\r\n* `Ctrl + Shift + E` split horizontally.\r\n* `Ctrl + Alt + Arrows` move between splits.\r\n* `Ctrl + Shift + Super + Arrows` resize splits.\r\n* `Ctrl + Shift + T` open new tab\r\n* `Ctrl + Shift + Arrows` move between tabs.\r\n\r\n### New themes: Ethereal and Hackerman\r\n\r\n<img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" alt=\"preview\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73cd0b45-9ed0-4076-a5c5-265139e005b8\" />\r\n\r\n<img width=\"2540\" height=\"1429\" alt=\"hackerman-6k-tc\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0639d26a-052e-40ff-bfdc-303cd63a15a9\" />\r\n\r\n### Visual theme picker\r\n\r\nThe theme picker new has visual previews of every included theme (and every extra theme can add preview.png in 16:9 to get the same):\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1734\" height=\"910\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf6376dd-9e9e-4380-97c8-3ae209b96d6b\" />\r\n\r\n### Bluetooth TUI\r\n\r\nWith improvements to [BlueTUI](https://github.com/pythops/bluetui), we're finally able to make it match the TUI used for wifi configuration. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1912\" height=\"1338\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37167876-0b8a-4f43-9a64-de3a99e25063\" />\r\n\r\n### Tobi's try\r\n\r\nManaging all your quick code experiments is made much nicer with @tobi's try. Automatically namespace your attempts by the data under `~/Work/tries`, delete them from the overview, and jump back into the action. See the [try page for more](https://github.com/tobi/try).\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1468\" height=\"532\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/239623a6-8b69-4db8-96a4-d301a065fb47\" />",
