If you want to add an extra background image to, say, the nord theme, you just put the file in ~/.config/omarchy/nord/backgrounds.\n\n~/.config/omarchy/[theme]/backgrounds\n\n~/.config/omarchy/nord/backgrounds\n\nYou can do this most easily by going to Install > Style > Background in the Omarchy Menu. That'll bring up the folder where the backgrounds for that theme is stored. Hit Super + Shift + F to start another file manager, find your background, copy it over.  Now it'll be included in the cycle of backgrounds you can move between using Super + Ctrl + Space.\n\nYou can find a huge collection of cool curated backgrounds on https://github.com/dharmx/walls."
