    "content": "### Universal copy/paste on `Super + C / V`\r\n\r\nNo more remembering that terminals need `Shift + Ctrl + C / V` and all other apps use `Ctrl + C / V`. Now you can use `Super + C / V` as a unified shortcut for copy/paste. `Super + X` is also mapped as cut, but note that this doesn't (and never did) work in the terminal.\r\n\r\nThis has required that we move app shortcuts to `Super + Shift + [letter]`. So terminal now starts on `Super + Shift + Return`, Calendar on `Super + Shift + C`, etc.\r\n\r\nThis also means fullscreen is now `Super + F` (instead of F11) and toggling a window between tiling/floating happens on `Super + T`.\r\n\r\nFor existing installations, this is an optional change that you'll be prompted to opt-in to during migration. For new installations, this is the new default. As always, you can see your keybindings on `Super + K`.\r\n\r\n### Clipboard manager on `Super + Ctrl + V`\r\n\r\nExpose Walker's built-in clipboard manager on `Super + Ctrl + V`.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1490\" height=\"996\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2e2bad9-d8f5-46ac-9131-74694a35b351\" />\r\n\r\n### Tiling groups\r\n\r\nTiling groups allows you to put any combination of windows into a tabbed group. You can move windows in and out of the group or remove the group entirely.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b6fddd7-58f0-4965-86c8-9cdad34dac1b\r\n\r\nHotkeys:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Toggle groups\r\nbindd = SUPER, G, Toggle window grouping, togglegroup\r\nbindd = SUPER ALT, G, Move active window out of group, moveoutofgroup\r\n\r\n# Join groups\r\nbindd = SUPER ALT, LEFT, Move window to group on left, moveintogroup, l\r\nbindd = SUPER ALT, RIGHT, Move window to group on right, moveintogroup, r\r\nbindd = SUPER ALT, UP, Move window to group on top, moveintogroup, u\r\nbindd = SUPER ALT, DOWN, Move window to group on bottom, moveintogroup, d\r\n\r\n# Navigate a single set of grouped windows\r\nbindd = SUPER ALT, TAB, Next window in group, changegroupactive, f\r\nbindd = SUPER ALT SHIFT, TAB, Previous window in group, changegroupactive, b\r\n\r\n# Activate window in a group by number\r\nbindd = SUPER ALT, 1, Switch to group window 1, changegroupactive, 1\r\nbindd = SUPER ALT, 2, Switch to group window 2, changegroupactive, 2\r\nbindd = SUPER ALT, 3, Switch to group window 3, changegroupactive, 3\r\nbindd = SUPER ALT, 4, Switch to group window 4, changegroupactive, 4\r\nbindd = SUPER ALT, 5, Switch to group window 5, changegroupactive, 5\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: These hotkeys are only available if you opt-in to the new Omarchy hotkeys brought on by the universal copy/paste change. This is due to the use of `Super + G` (which would otherwise conflict with the old Signal hotkey). If you don't opt-in, you can just copy these bindings to your own `~/.config/hypr/bindings.conf` file and set them as you please.\r\n\r\n### Smart screenshot selection\r\n\r\nWe've replaced the three different screenshot keybindings with a single smart version that selects windows when you hover over them, the whole screen on hover on the top bar, and custom region if you drag. This is now all available on `PrtScr`. This has made room for `Shift + PrtScr` to use the same smart selection, but then send the result straight to the clipboard without going through Slurp for editing first.\r\n\r\n### Live theme changes for neovim\r\n\r\nThe built-in themes now have live changes out of the box. For extra themes, you'll still need to restart neovim after first installing/selecting it.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a16e57d1-74f3-4fa4-9d78-d9654cee6863\r\n\r\n### Live theme changes for Obsidian\r\n\r\nSelect the `Omarchy` theme under _Appearance > Themes_ in Obsidian, and you'll get live theme changes.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"2876\" height=\"1862\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2209aa8-eabc-441b-8bf3-9b605e8cb930\" />\r\n\r\nNote: Your vaults must live in ~/Documents or ~/Dropbox for this to be picked up automatically. If you use a different location for your vaults, you must manually edit `~/.local/state/omarchy/obsidian-vaults` to add it.\r\n\r\n### Live theme changes for Cursor\r\n\r\nJust like VSCode, we now have live theming for Cursor. It's not supported by all themes, though. Of the built-in, you'll get Catppuccin, Catppuccin Latte, Everforest, Gruvbox, Nord, Ristretto, Rose Pine, Tokyo Night. The others are not supported.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"2832\" height=\"1820\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22fecf1a-b052-469c-a71f-5d0a92e5bb86\" />\r\n\r\n### Aether theme editor\r\n\r\nCreate your own Omarchy theme with @bjarneo's excellent Aether app. You can base your theme on an existing set, find the right wallpaper, and instantly apply it or export to share.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"2462\" height=\"1900\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4e51432-09bb-4902-9ec2-6d078219ec38\" />\r\n\r\n### Flexoki Light Theme\r\n\r\n<img width=\"2880\" height=\"1920\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24b17fa7-207c-429c-aa27-76e46c9398c0\" />\r\n\r\n<img width=\"2880\" height=\"1920\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/501c389a-c2d1-459f-9d79-80e3da00f068\" />\r\n\r\n### Windows VM\r\n\r\nRunning a Windows VM inside of Omarchy gives you an easy way out of running those few, rare applications that simply must be native, and aren't available on Linux. With _Install > Windows_, you'll end up with a [Docker-based Windows VM](https://github.com/dockur/windows). Note: There's no GPU pass-through (yet?), so it's not meant for gaming.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"2880\" height=\"1920\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7695058-881c-4d16-8714-2a4518331685\" />",
