That'll ensure that the new strategy for migrations is initialized, and any migrations you might have missed will be run. On your next update, you just run it once.\r\n\r\n### New font menu\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1236\" height=\"950\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1790e66b-632d-4427-a8fd-7d53ad490ec9\" />\r\n\r\n### New finder via application launcher\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1396\" height=\"858\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ff4d724-bfd7-4da8-8102-061c540edda2\" />\r\n\r\n(Note that the finder might take a while on big searches)\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/compare/v1.7.0...v1.8.0",
