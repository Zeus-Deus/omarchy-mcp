  "content": "Asahi Alarm is a version of Arch for Apple M1/M2 computers built on top of Asahi Linux. You can get Omarchy running on top of that with some effort. See the user-driven guide.\n\nYou can also install Omarchy inside a Parallels VM. Quite the cumbersome process, but there's a user-driven guide for that too.\n\nVirtualBox is a popular VM runner. You can run Omarchy inside that too. But performance probably won't be great.\n\nAnother popular VM runner for Windows. Omarchy has been setup inside of that as well.\n\nCachyOS is a fork of Arch with a range of performance optimizations applied. I was never able to see any advantage with my workloads in terms of performance, but if you want to give it a try, here's a guide to running Omarchy on top of CachyOS.\n\nThe Steam Deck runs on Arch, which means you can run Omarchy on your Steam Deck. Altynbek Orumbayev has a full setup script and explanation on how to do it. How cool is that!\n\nOmarchy is really Arch + Hyprland, but Henry Sipp has ported the essence of the setup to NixOS. So if you've been nix-pilled, here's a good starting point. It may or may not stay up-to-date with the latest Omarchy changes, but it's pretty cool none the less!\n\nIf you're trying to get Omarchy running on a configuration that isn't the default, you should join the #omarchy-on-other channel on our community Discord."
