They'll go away after the update has fully completed and you've restarted your system. But if you've added any windowrules or layerrules of your own, you'll need to convert them to the new syntax too. You can use https://itsohen.github.io/hyprrulefix/.",

    "content": "### Dictation via Voxtype\r\n\r\nVoxtype offers a variety of different local AI dictation models. You can install it using _Install > AI > Dictation_ where the default is a 150MB base English model. After it's installed, you can start dictating using `Super + Ctrl + X`. While dictating, you'll see a red mic in the center of the top menu, which you can click to pick another model (or just run `voxtype setup model` from terminal). Or right-click to edit the entire Voxtype configuration (or edit `~/.config/voxtype/config.toml`).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3d5156f-05e5-4f0f-9f71-b2022477d110\r\n\r\n### Hibernation + Suspend\r\n\r\nWith Linux running on a million different systems, there is varying levels of support for system sleep, so by default Omarchy will only show the options that work everywhere: Lock, screensaver, restart, shutdown. But plenty of systems do support hibernation and suspend, so now you can enable both via _Setup > System Sleep_.\r\n\r\nHibernation requires a swap subvolume of the same size as your physical RAM allotment. That'll automatically be setup when you run the _Enable Hibernate_ option. So too will configuration for suspend-to-hibernate after 30 minutes on systems that support it. Note that when you're waking from hibernation, you'll have to enter the password for both disk encryption and for the hyprlock screen.\r\n\r\n### OpenCode: AI agents for every model!\r\n\r\n[OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/) is a wonderful multi-provider agent terminal harness, which you can use to run Claude, Gemini, Codex alongside open-weight models like GLM-4.7 and MiniMax M2.1. The best way to use it is by navigating to your project, then using the new `c` alias to start OpenCode. That'll scope your context to just that project.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"2970\" height=\"1628\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d874ed9-58bd-4ae1-94ef-92c5b15bcc89\" />\r\n\r\n### Dynamic themes from colors.toml\r\n\r\nOmarchy themes apply to a lot of applications, like Ghostty/Alacritty/Kitty, btop, Chromium/Brave, mako, hyprlock, hyprland, sway, vscode, walker, and waybar. This meant a significant undertaking to bring a consistent color scheme to all these applications, but now you can ship your theme with just a colors.toml file, and the vast majority of these app-specific configs will be generated from that. See the slimmed down requirements for a new theme here: https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/tree/dev/themes/tokyo-night. And the colors.toml file is just the 24 colors needed to generate all of these:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"962\" height=\"866\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23ac6f57-337a-43a0-8e39-fd7914362231\" />\r\n\r\n### Gruvbox impressionism\r\n\r\nNew primary background for the Gruvbox theme: The Backwater (1903).\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1156\" height=\"658\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ada6dc0e-2acf-4090-9aa1-3923297a9c29\" />",
