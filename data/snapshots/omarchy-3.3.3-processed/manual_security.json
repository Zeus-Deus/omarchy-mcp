  "content": "Omarchy takes security extremely seriously. This is meant to be an operating system that you can use to do Real Work in the Real World. Where losing a laptop can't lead to a security emergency. So here's what we do:\n\nFull-disk encryption is mandatory: This is the most important step to securing the physical protection of your data. If your computer is lost or stolen, the data is fully encrypted using standard LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup).\n\nFirewall is enabled by default: All incoming traffic by default except for port 22 for ssh and port 53317 for LocalSend. We even lock down Docker access using the ufw-docker setup to prevent that your containers are accidentally exposed to the world.\n\nArch always have the latest updates: Arch, the underlying distro that Omarchy is built on, is a rolling distribution. This means that any security vulnerability that's discovered and patched in any package is immediately available for install using yay -Syu. You're always running the latest, most secure versions of everything that way.\n\nOmarchy maintains its own packages and mirror: Omarchy only relies on packages from Arch's own core/extra/multilib repositories and its own Omarchy Package Repository by default. You can install software directly from AUR, but Omarchy does not by default. Even for the optional installs.\n\nCloudflare protects us from DDoS: All the Omarchy distribution infrastructure — the ISOs, the Omarchy packages, the Arch mirror — is protected behind Cloudflare's formidable DDoS shield and hosted on their CDN. This provides superb availability.\n\nThe public key for all ISO signatures and Omarchy repo package is 40DFB630FF42BCFFB047046CF0134EE680CAC571 (verify at openpgp.org). The omarchy/omarchy-keyring package contains this as well and will be used to rollout any potential updates seamlessly.\n\n40DFB630FF42BCFFB047046CF0134EE680CAC571\n\nomarchy/omarchy-keyring\n\nYou can find the signature for any ISO release by adding .sig to the URL. Like https://iso.omarchy.org/omarchy-x.x.x.iso.sig."
