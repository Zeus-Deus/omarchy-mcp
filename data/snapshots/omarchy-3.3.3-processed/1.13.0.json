    "content": "This release includes a revamp of the PATH and how Omarchy finds its bins. It's very important that when you are asked to relaunch Hyprland, that you do so, and then run _Omarchy > Update_ (or `omarchy-update`) again afterwards. That'll ensure everything is migrated correctly.\r\n\r\nOtherwise you can just update by clicking the update-available icon next to the clock (if you see that), by running _Update > Omarchy_ from the Omarchy Menu, or by `omarchy-update` on the cli.",
