I don't need to know the user, because it's always me, and I don't need to know the time, because it's always at the top.\n\nIf you want more information or style, you can change the Starship.rs configuration in ~/.config/starship.toml. There's a lot you can do. Just don't go overboard (or do go overboard, do whatever you want, it's your computer!)\n\n~/.config/starship.toml"
