Remove the confusingly prolific hotkeys + power icon in the top right. `Super + Esc` is now required learning to operate Omarchy. Work by @npenza.\r\n* Switch from iwctl to Impala TUI for selecting Wi-Fi networks by @da-maltsev\r\n* Switch from hyprpolkitagent to polkit-gnome to better support fingerprint authentication by @dhh\r\n* Remove Clipse as a clipboard manager as it would store passwords from 1password in plain text by @dhh\r\n* Fix cleaning up yay-bin after installing it by @bbondier \r\n* Fix that wifi/bluetooth/volume windows were too small by @dhh\r\n* Fix F keys on Apple-mode keyboards like the Flow84 permantly by @reshadman\r\n* Fix user keybindings weren't being included in `Super + K` by @dhh\r\n* Fix that 1password wouldn't work with 2FA setup because `gnome-keyring` was missing by @dhh\r\n\r\nRun `omarchy-update` to update. Then enjoy this beautiful login flow on your next reboot:\r\n\r\n![2025-07-09-133334_hyprshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b166611-7591-4942-964c-3708832c8955)\r\n![2025-07-09-133346_hyprshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01ea7868-68f3-4426-9d02-5ce17b9b354c)",
