  "content": "Omarchy is an omakase distribution based on Arch Linux and the tiling window manager Hyprland. It ships with everything a modern software developer needs to be productive immediately from Neovim (btw) to Spotify, Chromium to Typora, and Ghostty to LibreOffice. Hell, even Zoom is there!\n\nThis isn't just a grab bag of preinstalled packages, though. It's a complete system designed with both aesthetics and productivity in mind. Because a beautiful system is a motivating system, and productivity has always been downstream from motivation. There's zero bloat here: Just everything I use.\n\nIt's true that developing an eye for the beauty of a TUI-heavy, theme-delighted, tiling-window-managed system like Omarchy can be an acquired taste. But that's why you're here, isn't it? To experience something a little outside of your comfort zone? To embark on a little bit of an adventure into a new way of working with computers? I hope so.\n\nOmarchy isn't like Windows and it's not like macOS either. It's not trying to be as familiar as possible. It's trying to be beautiful and better. Embrace the Linux-ness of it all. Manually editing some config files, sure. Heavy on the terminal, definitely.\n\nLet's get started with the basics."
