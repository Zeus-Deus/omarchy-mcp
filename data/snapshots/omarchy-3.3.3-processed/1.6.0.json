It should look and feel almost exactly like Wofi, it'll just be way faster, there's now a built-in calculator on \"345+223\" that'll put the result on the clipboard, and you can find any emoji by starting search with a dot, so \":fire\" will find something like \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25, which return puts on the clipboard.\r\n\r\nFabulous work by Walker creator @abenz1267 and @ryanrhughes to make all the tweaks required for nailing the Omarchy aesthetic and feel \ud83e\udd18\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1368\" height=\"838\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/502ac33c-b7f4-423a-b40c-e0c5ce32ab1f\" />\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1360\" height=\"830\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce47cca9-a9b9-4c4a-ab89-6258ca0b49d4\" />",
