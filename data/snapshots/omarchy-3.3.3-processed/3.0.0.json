    "content": "# What changed?\r\n\r\nOmarchy 3.0 is a major upgrade for new installations and a wonderful level-up for existing users. The new ISO doesn't require internet at all, and you can install it in _less than two minutes_ on the fastest systems.\r\n\r\nYou can now also install Omarchy on most pre-M MacBooks with support for keyboards, wifi, and the T1 and T2 security chips. This is a decade-long hardware portfolio that we're trying to cover as well as we can out of the box. There may still be issues and trade-offs, so only install this on hardware that you're okay experimenting with! \r\n\r\nExisting installations can upgrade as per-normal using `Update > Omarchy`. New installations should download the fresh, all-inclusive ISO before beginning: https://iso.omarchy.org/omarchy-3.0.1.iso. This is a 7GB ISO that includes the entire system for offline installation (just 1/10th the size of macOS!). \r\n\r\n_Note: Ghostty compatibility requires Ghostty 1.2.0, which is still not released on the Arch repository. Please hold off on using that until it is (or install the 1GB+ dev version under ghostty-git from AUR). Hopefully @mitchellh will get it out soon!_\r\n\r\n### New super-fast installation ISO\r\n\r\n* Add everything needed for new all-inclusive ISO that doesn't need internet by @ryanrhughes\r\n* Add new styled install flow with centered logo and tailed logging by @ryanrhughes   \r\n* Add option to upload install logs to 0x0.st if installation fails by @ryanrhughes \r\n* Add invitation to setup wifi and update system on new ISO installations by @dhh\r\n* Add [precompiled lazyvim installation for nvim](https://github.com/omacom-io/omarchy-lazyvim) by @ryanrhughes \r\n\r\n### MacBook Compatibility\r\n\r\n* Add support for T2 macs with custom kernel and drivers by @ryanrhughes + @nunix\r\n* Add compatibility with T1 MacBook keyboards so they work on the decryption screen by @joelgaff \r\n* Add compatibility with Broadcom BCM4360 MacBooks (2013-2015) to get working wifi by @ryanrhughes \r\n\r\n### New features\r\n\r\n* Add screen recording indicator to the top bar when recording (clicking will stop) by @eifr + @dhh \r\n* Add option to sign into Google account for settings sync in Chromium via _Install > Service > Chromium Account_ by @hjanuschka \r\n* Add `omarchy-launch-or-focus` to either launch or focus an app and apply it to several binding defaults by @v-oleg\r\n* Add default `~/Work` directory (with mise configuration for ./bin PATH to avoid security issue) by @ryanrhughes \r\n* Add option to view PKGBUILD before installing AUR packages on alt+b under Install > AUR by @rajayonin\r\n* Add support for zoom meeting links in the zoom web app by @ATeal \r\n* Add support for changing terminal and editor system-wide in `~/.config/uwsm/default` (see _Setup > Defaults_) by @eifr + @dhh\r\n* Add _Install > Terminal_ for picking between Alacritty, Ghostty, Kitty as your fully-themed default terminal by @dhh\r\n* Add Zig language server when installing from Install > Development by @DoKoB0512 \r\n* Add _Update > Branch_ to switch between master and dev branch (don't use dev unless you're doing actual development or testing \u2014 it won't be stable!) by @dhh\r\n* Add Walker service back to get faster application launcher and Omarchy Menu start times (if you see any memory leaks, use _Update > Process > Walker_ to restart \u2014 this will be fixed proper in Omarchy 3.1).\r\n\r\n### New hotkeys\r\n\r\n* Add `Alt + Shift + L` to copy current URL from Chromium and the frameless webapps by @jankeesvw \r\n* Add `Ctrl + Super + S`  (or _Trigger > Share_) and for using LocalSend to share clipboard/file/folder quickly by @guilhermetk\r\n* Add `Super + Backspace` to toggle transparency on/off for any window by @dhh\r\n* Add `Super + Shift + B` to start browser in private mode by @kodnin\r\n* Add `Super + Ctrl + Tab` to go to the former workspace by @zaborowskimichal\r\n* Add `Alt + F11` to toggle full width on a window by @c4software \r\n* Add calculator key binding for default calculator by @SamrudhNelli\r\n\r\n### Aesthetics\r\n\r\n* Add blurred theme background to the lock screen by @dhh\r\n* Add theme switching for VS Code by @OmarSkalli \r\n* Add theme switching for eza by @sgruendel\r\n* Add theme switching for Kitty terminal by @vyrx-dev\r\n* Add theme switching for Brave (with a slight delay until next Brave release where it'll be instant) by @hjanuschka + @dhh\r\n* Add browser theme switching based on upcoming --refresh-platform-policy flag shipping in Chromium 141 and next Brave by @hjanuschka \r\n* Add `~/.config/hypr/looknfeel.conf` to new installations to suggest ways to change the Hyprland aesthetics by @dhh\r\n* Add _Style > Hyprland_ to tweak Hyprland look'n'feel from the menu by @med502\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Fix waybar flashing or disappearing after update-available icon kicked off an update by @dhh\r\n* Fix setting gnome dark mode and themes on first install by @dhh\r\n* Fix audio output switch should only move between available outputs by @elpritchos \r\n* Fix config error warning from Hyprland 0.51 yanking workspace_swipe by @dhh\r\n* Fix incompatibility with freetype2 update and plymouth by @ryanrhughes \r\n* Fix that default hyprsunset config shouldn't turn off until 7am by default by @tmkn \r\n* Fix remove --freeze from hyprshot again as it was unstable by @dhh\r\n* Fix cursor was visible during screensaver by @alexperreault\r\n* Fix updating time + tz should give you feedback while its happening by @dhh\r\n* Fix fcitx5 issue with other languages in Obsidian by running it with --wayland-ime by @ashutoshbw\r\n* Fix screenrecording on Intel should now use accelerated graphics by @eifr\r\n* Fix gum should be available to the install script as soon as possible so we can offer retry on failures by @dhh\r\n* Fix screensaver would persists in workspace after using other workspaces by @manuel1618\r\n* Fix power profile not opening after folks had installed Python via mise by @dhh\r\n* Fix the temporary patch to force Ruby to build with gcc14 by @dhh",
